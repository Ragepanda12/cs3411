# cs3411

Final project for CS3411 17s1.
AI that navigates around a 2d world picking up tools (Axe, Key, Dynamite, Raft)
to traverse obstacles (Tree, Door, Wall, Water) in order to pick up the Treasure
and return to the start location.

Written in Java by Mendel Liang and Alex Ong
Decider.java contains logic to do with what the AI should do with a given world model
Model.java holds all information that has been gathered by the AI at any given time,
as the AI can only see a 5x5 grid around it at any given time
